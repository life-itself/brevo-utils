# **Day 4: The magical apple tree: once upon a time in the digital economy**

Dear future diginomist,

Maybe when you hear the word economics you switch off? Or maybe you think economics is all about making money? Well today we’re here to tell you that you can get everything you need to know about diginomics (and legacy economics) with a simple good old fairy tale. Are you ready? Well strap in!

**Once upon a time there was an apple farmer called Mr Gates.** Mr Gates had many neighbours who were also apple farmers. Two who shall be important to our tale were Mrs Linux and Mrs Huntingdon. Mr Gates, Mrs Linux and Mrs Huntingdon all grew apples together, along with all the other apple farmers in the region. There was a good demand for apples, and all the apple farmers were able to have a successful business and live a good and happy life.

**Mr Gates buys the magical apple seed.** One day, after Mr Gates had finished his work he came back home and sat on his porch smoking his favourite pipe when a witch walked past. This witch offered Mr Gates a special seed that she said would turn into the most marvellous apple tree that would bring riches beyond imagining. Now Mr Gates was a little suspicious but he was also ambitious. After some thought he decided he would pay her the 10 gold coins she asked. 

Excited about the prospect of this magical apple tree, Mr Gates planted the seed immediately, and went to bed.

Waking up the next morning, Mr Gates started to walk through his field to start his work like yesterday and every other day before that. To his surprise, the seed had grown overnight into a tree with apples - my gosh, he thought, this really is magic.

**Mr Gates has an abundance of apples.** Plucking an apple from the tree to taste, he heard an interesting sound almost like a “pop”, coming from the tree. He looked over and to his surprise he saw that the branch he’d pulled the apple from was still completely full! Tentatively he picked another apple, and then another, continuing until the farmer paused to stare in awe at the mound of apples by his side, and the still entirely full tree in front of him.

**Mr Gates is overjoyed by the thought of riches and is uncharacteristically generous.** Mr Gates was surprised and excited about his apple tree. He was especially excited about the riches he was going to soon have from his magical harvest. He was in such a good mood that when he saw his neighbours Mrs Linux and her son and Mrs Huntingdon walking past on their way home he gave them a few of his new magical apples for them to taste how juicy they were. 

**An accidental discovery.** Whilst eating his apple, Mrs Linux’s son dropped his apple on the floor, and one of the seeds fell out into the soil. The next day Mrs Linux woke up to find a new tree on her farm! Where has this come from? she wonders. Plucking an apple from the tree she sees it immediately replenishes itself. Confused, she does it again, and again, until like Mr Gates, she now has a pile of apples next to her and a full tree of fruit in front of her. Eureka she thinks!

Mrs Linux immediately calls Mrs Huntingdon to share the news. Astonished, Mrs Huntingdon plants a seed from her apple, and lo and behold the next day she has a magical apple tree too. Each farmer decides to give a few apples to their close friends and families so they too can grow their own apples. These friends and family members, also thought the same, and gave a few apples to their friends and family. Within a week everyone has a magical apple tree in their garden, and now no one needs extra apples from Mr Gates.

**All for nothing.** Dismayed and upset by this sudden turn of events, Mr Gates grows increasingly angry. He had spent 10 gold coins, a year's worth of savings, on this magical apple tree and suddenly everyone has their own apple trees from his! They are such free-riders he thinks!

**The witch’s new pear tree finds no takers.** The next year the witch comes back to town with an exciting new gift. In exchange for another 10 coins, she has a seed to grow a magical pear tree! She visits Mr Gates first to see if he would like to purchase it, no, absolutely not, last year I paid you 10 gold coins and got nothing back! He cries before slamming the door in her face. Surprised, she goes to Mrs Linux next door, no! She cries as well. This is certainly unusual thought the witch and she tries Mrs Huntingdon, and then every other person she meets, all of whom say no! The witch leaves town with the seed for the magical pear tree still in her possession, and everyone in the land misses out on pears. 


## And this is the problem with costless copying

As we hope is clear, there is a moral to this story. The famous “free rider” problem. Whilst everyone benefits from the magical apple tree, no-one may want to contribute once they have their “free” copy.

So too, for digital stuff like software or movies. Whilst everyone can have a copy – for free, the first copy needs to be paid for. And if creators know they won’t get paid they may not create in the first place and we’ll all miss out.

**The first copy can be expensive.** Often creating the first copy of digital goods can be highly expensive – just as it was expensive for Mr Gates to buy the apple tree (or, more specifically, costly for the witch to do her magical research to create new types of magical seeds!).

**This combination of costless copying and expensive first copy creates a problem.**

There’s even examples from the physical world: imagine a concert performance conducted outside on a public beachfront. The promoters might be able to cordon off an area for the paid attendees, but it will be impossible to stop passers by from hanging around just outside and enjoying the concert for free. This problem is commonly known as the _free-rider problem_, and it comes from the fact that it’s hard to stop people who haven’t paid for an item nonetheless accessing it for free.

At least in a “state of nature” i.e. without intervention, this problem also applies to digital goods. Costless copying means the first person to purchase or obtain a copy could then theoretically supply every other person in the world who wanted one, for free. As accidentally happened to Mr Gates.

This problem simply doesn’t exist for physical goods like cars. When I’m driving my car it’s physically impossible for anyone else to drive it, and there’s no way I can make a physical copy of all the atoms which make up the car. This means anyone else who wants one will have to pay full price to the manufacturer just like I did. 


## The problem for creators: free-riding makes it hard to recover your upfront costs

Digital goods creators therefore face a problem. They need a way of recouping their (often significant) costs to create the first “copy”, whilst being assured they can make enough of a return that the risk involved in creating it in the first place is worthwhile. Otherwise, like Mr Gates, they too will lose their 10 gold coins. 

However, the ability for anyone who possesses a copy of their goods to then costlessly copy and distribute it to anyone they like for free fundamentally undermines the ability of the initial creator to make any money. Think of music pirating: why would I pay for the MP3 file of a new song when I can download it for free? 


## Today’s summary 

Today we introduced you to Mr Gates and his magical apple tree, who demonstrated what it means to live in a digital economy. We explored the potential pitfalls of costless copying, highlighting that **the first copy is generally expensive and without much guarantee of receiving the investment back**, which makes it risky. Especially, because in the digital economy, **there is the big problem of free-riding**.
