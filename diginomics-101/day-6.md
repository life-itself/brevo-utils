# **Day 6: Costless copying revisited**

Dear future diginomist,

Most people want to have their cake and eat it, a bit like this hungry child below. I mean of course they do, the cake is delicious! When we devour it in one bite, (OK maybe two if we‚Äôre realistic), without really thinking, it doesn‚Äôt always sit well, or maybe it wasn‚Äôt even ours to eat in the first place! Well this is kind of what happens with costless copying and the rules of the legacy economy, they don‚Äôt sit well together, and some of us are left hungry because of it.

So let‚Äôs dive into today‚Äôs lesson like a fork into a slice of cake!

## Houston we have a problem 

Let's get back to costless copying, the key principle that when coupled with old world rules such as exclusive rights, creates the two problems we spoke about yesterday; that of Hansel and Gretel not having enough food; and of the creation of a monopoly resulting in a massive inequality around the distribution of wealth and power.

Now, first of all it‚Äôs worth noting that exclusive rights generally aren't a problem in the world of atoms, or at least not in the same way. But when we apply this old way of thinking to our new world we encounter problems on both individual and societal levels. 


## First of all let‚Äôs look at exclusive use 

Another way to think about the essential difference between the old atoms economy and the new bits economy is through exclusive and non-exclusive use. 

**Atoms are exclusive in use.** They can only be used by one person at a time and trying to share something that is exclusive results in a loss or less for people. Only one person can wear the shoes at a time, atomically there is no other way. Now, in the old world, from a social and economic point of view, exclusive rights are not a problem. They are your shoes and you get to control exclusively who wears them and where they go. This is how we operate in a number of different scenarios, which socially makes sense: I had it, it‚Äôs mine, I made it, it‚Äôs mine and so I get to say what happens to it. But, the key point to understand here is that this social rule only makes sense because of this fact of nature that **atoms can only ever be exclusive in use**!

Now, when you move into the new digital world you realise that these principles no longer apply. The digital economy allows for non-exclusive use because of the ability to share without loss, or as we have been referring to it, the ability to costlessly copy. Now, this non-exclusivity can feel jarring when we are operating from an old world way of thinking. Which is what is important for us to discuss more because ...


## Bits are different, remember!! 

**Would you like some cake?** In the new digital economy of bits, you can share, share, and share some more and you never lose out. This world is no longer like the world of the last slice of chocolate cake. Do you remember that world as a child?  That deliciously gooey indulgent chocolate cake that you were told you had to share with your brother / sister / friend. Did you want to share? Of course you didn‚Äôt. Did you feel happy about being told you had to? No!!! Of course not, because in the last slice of chocolate cake world sharing means less for you and with food and other atom based objects, there is no getting away from this fact. We are born in a world of physical stuff where sharing means less, fullstop. BUT, economically we have moved from this atoms based world into a digital world of bits and this means things are actually very different!

**Bits can be costlessly copied, which means they by their very nature are non-exclusive**. This non-exclusivity and costless copying means that sharing is actually very natural and cost effective i.e. it has no cost. Imagine if that last slice of chocolate cake could ‚Äúmagically‚Äù re-appear every time you ate it. Of course you‚Äôd share it with your friend, your brother, your neighbour, hell, you‚Äôd share it with everyone, because you knew it would also always be available to you too! 

Now, this is exactly where the problem is arising, all of these sharable bits (of information) are not necessarily being shared because of exclusive rights. So we have a new economy being restricted by an old rule. It‚Äôs like making your 7 year old child wear their 4 year old school uniform, it doesn‚Äôt fit, it‚Äôs uncomfortable and it‚Äôs going to cause a lot of problems.


## Problems of old rules in a new economy 

The outcomes created in our societies are the product of two things. The physical facts about the world around us, and the social rules we create around them. Using old rules designed around physical atoms in the new digital economy of bits is a recipe for failure. This is true at the level of individuals, organisations and wider society as a whole.

**The same rules have very different results** depending on the nature of the underlying stuff we‚Äôre applying the rules to - the atoms or the bits. 

Exclusive rights + atoms = good ol‚Äô property rights economy (worked pretty well!). Exclusive rights + bits = oh dear really not so good.

In the digital economy, the application of exclusive ‚Äúintellectual property‚Äù rights actually translate into being ‚Äúmonopoly rights‚Äù and, as you can probably figure out, these monopoly rights have the same consequence of monopoly as in the economy of atoms: things are more expensive and there is restricted access (not to mention they harm innovation and a whole other array of issues. But for more on this please see our mini course_ Discover Hidden Digital Cause of Rising Inequality_).

OK, but we already live like this, you might be thinking. Well, yes, but hold on, because remember we now live in a digital economy that has atoms in it sometimes, we are no longer in an atom's economy with a sprinkle of digital.

**So what is the problem?** The problem is that these exclusive rights or monopoly rights when coupled with costless copying result in a monopoly. This monopoly further feeds rising inequality and stagnation on individual and societal levels. Which is pretty serious stuff, of which the majority of us will all suffer the consequences of.

This monopoly ultimately means that only certain people can gain access, because sharing is not free, and that the competition around the product is limited or removed, as only one or a few individuals control the distribution and access, like Mr Gates did with his magical apple tree. The real consequence of this is that people who could often benefit from the innovation miss out, like Hansel and Gretel. 

**Medicines are a great real life example of this**. Pharmaceutical companies price their medicines at a rate where they can get a good return on their large initial research and development investments. The flip side of this is that all over the world there are millions of people who can‚Äôt afford life saving medicines. In the worst cases, companies don‚Äôt even bother trying to develop drugs for certain diseases, because those worst affected won‚Äôt be able to pay enough for them. This example highlights the core tension that is central to costless copying and the digital economy - that of access vs innovation. 

Below, we‚Äôve pulled into a table an overview of the problems related to exclusive rights and the two economies of atoms and bits using the magical apple tree. 


<table cellpadding="10" border="1">
  <tr>
   <td></td>
   <td><strong>Atoms + Exclusive rights</strong></td>
   <td><strong>Bits + Exclusive rights</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Hansel and Gretel (access and quality of life)</strong></td>
   <td>There‚Äôs a limited set of apples. To give apples to them means taking them from someone else.</td>
   <td>Hansel and Gretel could eat - and everyone else would still have as many apples as they wanted ü•≥. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Competition</strong></td>
   <td>We can have lots of apple farmers happily competing.</td>
   <td>Law of one or a few. We only need one magical apple tree. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Inequality</strong></td>
   <td>Inequality is reasonable - at least in a free, competitive economy.</td>
   <td>Mr Gates can supply everyone. Plus each new apple costs him nothing so it‚Äôs very profitable. Mr Gates gets all the money and all the other farmers go out of business => there is a massive increase in inequality.</td>
  </tr>
</table>



## The negative impact of outdated rules 

So as you can see, in applying these outdated rules to the digital economy, intellectual property rights (exclusive use) are actually monopoly rights, and when we add this to copyless copying we can suddenly see what was in plain sight all along: 

<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;">Costless copying + Exclusive rights = Monopoly + Inequality</p>

This is why the growing inequality we see or experience cannot be solved by using old rules in the new economy. Just in the way that we can‚Äôt apply these new rules to the old economy either i.e. we can‚Äôt share the shoes at the same time, either I wear them or you do. 

We've outlined the negative impacts of using old rules in a new economy. But we‚Äôve also seen a way out. Remember that social outcomes are the product of physical reality and social rules. The physical reality of the digital age, that costlessly copyable bits are fundamentally different from atoms, means that the rules we choose to use can be fundamentally different too. **New rules can lead to new outcomes, and a better economy for all of us. **

‚è© Next up‚Ä¶ The question of how to balance a digital economy of costless copying (new world) with exclusive rights (old world) is creating a core tension between two areas, that of access and innovation. In the next lesson we will address whether this core tension can be resolved.
