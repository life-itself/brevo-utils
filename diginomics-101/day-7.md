# **Day 7: Core tension: access vs innovation**

Dear future diginomist,

We can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs your final lesson! With all your new found knowledge related to the digital economy, we are sure you can see the benefits and the problems related to how we are currently navigating things. It might feel like a bit of a tightrope walk, precariously balancing two extremes and you‚Äôd be right. 

Yesterday we spoke about how applying the old rules to the new economy, aside from creating mass inequality, are also bringing into our awareness a core tension between access and innovation that arises from costless copying. So if you‚Äôre ready, let‚Äôs go walk this tightrope together!

## The two extremes

If we consider the two extreme approaches that can be taken based on the digital economy we now live in, we have the monopolists, who want exclusive ownership and in the other camp, and we have the hippies, who want everything to be shared freely. Which one is right? We‚Äôll neither, because the point is that both will have problems, and this creates a core tension between the two camps and the two areas of access and innovation.


## The economy of hyper monopoly capitalism

In the monopoly capitalist economy, some people have access to these bits of information, and some people don‚Äôt. The positive of this, driven by financial incentives, is that it can and does allow for more innovation due to the availability of more resources. However, it creates a key problem in relation to the usage, **often to ensure that the financial remuneration is there, the innovation created has limited or restricted access and use.**

However, even the best invention is no good to anyone if nobody uses it. As we‚Äôve discussed before, attaching high prices to the sale of digital goods and limiting how they can be reused and passed on can be a huge barrier to them being accessed in the first place. You might make enough money to keep the business running, but this type of approach prevents a significant number of people who‚Äôd get a lot of good from your product from ever being able to access it.

## The economy of hippiedom

On the other hand,  if we go to the land of the hippie, where everything is shared and there is free access for everyone, we also encounter problems. What incentive is there in hippiedom to create anything in the first place if it is going to cost you a lot of time, money and energy without any recuperation of this? **This type of open access can result in the loss of drive towards innovation and creation because the first ‚Äúcopy‚Äù is often very costly**, and if once a creation has been made there is no direct reward or replenishment of these costs, less people are likely to innovate over time.

**<p style="text-align:center;padding:10px 0;">Open access = Limited/restricted innovation</p>**

**So what do we do? Or are we stuck with this core tension?** Well clearly, some form of intervention is needed to ensure creators have a financial incentive to produce digital goods, and that these digital goods are accessible by those who need and want it. But most ways of doing this pose a dilemma to wider society: increasing money for creators will mean artificially raising prices above the cost of copying, which is currently costless - the beauty of this new economy. Which again, also can limit access for some people. But more than that, digital goods further improve society the more they are used because their use allows for new, socially beneficial knowledge and data to be produced. 

Think of a musician who is inspired by another piece of music to write a beautiful piece of their own, or an inventor using a computer aided design package to come up with an innovative new product. These acts of creation are based on access to other digital goods which inspire and enable them. This means the losses from reduced access and innovation are far greater than we might first realise.


## Are we stuck with this tension . . . 

Now whatever one thinks of the profit motive, the sad thing is that in the case of digital goods things don‚Äôt need to be this way. Costless copying opens up new possibilities for access and, under the right conditions, makes this widespread access compatible with profits which simply aren‚Äôt there in the physical economy. Failures to recognise this are a huge blocker to success. 

**So what are the options?** Well, in an ideal world, the hippies and the monopoly capitalists would have a baby, and we would have lots of access and lots of innovation.

## Today‚Äôs summary

In the final lesson of Diginomics 101 we learnt about the core tension between access and innovation that arises from costless copying. Access is limited under monopoly capitalism, whilst innovation is limited in hippiedom. So what can we do? Are we limited to simply finding the best trade-off: a bit more access for a bit more innovation or vice versa? **Or is there a way to get the best of both worlds?** 

‚è© Next up‚Ä¶ But is this balance even possible? Can we have the best of both worlds? Or are we stuck somewhere on the dotted line? How can we pay for the first copy _and_ have open access? These are all big questions that we address in our next course‚Ä¶ 


## What‚Äôs next?

Firstly, congratulations on reaching the end of our final lesson üéâ. 

We‚Äôve covered a lot over these past 7 lessons, which we hope you‚Äôve found informative and digestible!

üç∞ Of course, the learning doesn‚Äôt have to stop here if you feel hungry for more! As with all new knowledge, it is best when it is shared! Don‚Äôt keep these important topics a secret. We encourage you to engage in conversations with people to start to help us spread the word. 

üì£ We‚Äôd also really love your feedback on this newly completed course so we can continue to improve it. Tell us what you loved and what could be better [here](https://forms.gle/xBRkMaau6ws1wA8h6).

Secondly, we would like to invite you to come and join us in the next course, _Paying for the First Copy: Designing Digital Business Models_. In this course you can find out: 


ü§î How do we pay for the first copy? What options are there? Is there a way out of the core tension? A way to have the best of both worlds?

üçê We introduce you to the topic of an open revolution and we invite the witch to come back as the village council gets together to consider paying the witch for the magical pear tree.
