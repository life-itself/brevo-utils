# **Day 3: Costless copying: the essential difference between atoms and bits**

Dear future diginomist,

We know you‚Äôre still waiting for the answer to yesterday‚Äôs question - what is the difference between digital stuff and atom stuff. We‚Äôll get to it soon. But, first, take a moment to think about sharing, do you like to share? How does it make you feel? Sharing is at the heart of today‚Äôs lesson.

So without further ado, let us share the lesson with you.

## This is key to everything

Yesterday we learnt that the (non GMO) banana was the odd one out from these three images. Let‚Äôs recap and then dive in more to explain why.

Yesterday we learnt that the banana is the item that is primarily made, or whose value comes from, atoms whilst the other two are primarily made of information ‚Äì even if they have some atoms too! 

The crucial difference between an item being made of atoms or being made of bits is the principle of **costless copying**. And this, costless copying, is key to EVERYTHING.

Costless copying is a BIG DEAL. It is like the invention of the match to those trying to start a fire, or the steam engine to the industrial revolution. It changes EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING. E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G. 


## What is costless copying exactly?

Costless copying in a nutshell, is the ability for a second, a third, and/or multiple copies to continually be (re)produced from an original item for little or no cost. **Bits of information can literally be copied costlessly**, and this is the fundamental difference, because atom‚Äôs can‚Äôt. 

Let me try and convey how much of a seismic shift to our economy this actually is.

**How to feed five thousand.** To do this I‚Äôm going to introduce the story of the loaves and the fishes. Have you heard this story? Well, in short, Jesus and his disciples had only 5 loaves of bread and 2 fishes, which they needed to use to feed thousands of people. Obviously, any sane person can see this isn‚Äôt going to go very far physically. So, it is what happened next that provided the miracle. Jesus multiplied (or to make this example relevant to this course, costlessly copied) these loaves of bread and fishes so that there were enough to go around, and even some spare! 

It was a miracle! 

And this is EXACTLY what is happening in our digital world - bits of information are miraculously being multiplied again, and again, and again for little to no cost!

Miracle!!!


## Let‚Äôs examine what this means in more depth

<table width="100%" style="max-width:400px;">

**How much does each item cost?** Let‚Äôs get back to our (non-GMO) banana. Let‚Äôs say that our (non GMO) banana costs 1 Euro to be produced, a movie 10M Euros and a new drug 100M Euros. These are what we would class as our initial costs for the first item.

<table width="100%" style="max-width:400px;">
  <tr><td><img src="https://github.com/life-itself/diginomics/blob/main/brevo-assets/day-3-image-3.jpg?raw=true" width="100%" /></td></tr>
</table>

Now, after I have created the first item, if I want to create a second, a third and so on, what are the costs? 

<table width="100%" style="max-width:400px;">
  <tr><td><img src="https://github.com/life-itself/diginomics/blob/main/brevo-assets/day-3-image-4.jpg?raw=true" width="100%" /></td></tr>
</table>

Well, they look something like this ‚¨ÜÔ∏è. 

The items that contain the bits, the digital information, are reproduced at a fraction of the cost - 1000m:1 and 100m:1, so you could say these are almost costless to copy (after we have the first item). Whereas, the cost to produce more of an item containing atoms is close to the same cost as the first item - 1:1.

It is this fundamental difference of **costless copying** that affects why the old rules of the legacy economy of atoms no longer fits the new digital economy of bits.


## We can't all wear the same shoes, but we can all play the same music

Think of your most useful physical possession. It might be your car, a hedge trimmer, your shoes, anything. Now, however much you might like to, it should be pretty obvious that you can‚Äôt simply click your fingers and distribute copies of this item to your entire family. Well, this isn‚Äôt the case with digital goods. That insightful report you just found online? Shareable to your entire family chat group in seconds. The same goes for the photos of your holiday, or your new favourite song. We could go on here but you get the idea. And the magic of sharing in the digital economy is that it does not mean less for you, like in the old model.

**Is there a limit?** As there is no cost to create additional copies, it makes no difference whether 2 people use a digital good or 2 million. Only 1 person can drive your car or use your hedge trimmer at once. If we both want the same car or trimmer, then we each have to pay for the extra materials and manufacturing to create them. But an unlimited number of people can listen to the same digitally recorded song at once, as there are no extra costs involved in copying the original to distribute. 

**This means that providing digital goods to everyone for free is at least possible, as long as you can somehow cover the initial costs of creation.** A business or even a government who just decided to give everyone on the planet a new car would run into financial trouble pretty quickly, as the costs for producing each new vehicle mounts up. But software providers the world over are managing to provide open source software to huge numbers of people without any such problems. There are over 3 billion people currently using a smartphone running Android, Google‚Äôs open source operating system. And that hasn‚Äôt cost Google any meaningful amount more than if there were only 30. The fact that the digital economy doesn‚Äôt play by the same rules means that an entirely different approach, and thus an entirely different world, is possible.


## Sit and let this sink-in. It‚Äôs the miracle hiding in plain sight.

This is HUGE. Just stop and take this in for a second. Seriously.

Up until now, **our whole economy and society was built on scarcity, if I have it, you can‚Äôt.** **But our new digital economy is a world of abundance, if I have it you can have it too! It‚Äôs a world of infinite costless copying**. This is the complete opposite of the old world, the legacy economy.

Let‚Äôs recap to really drive this point home: 

Costless copying is the **essential, fundamental difference** between the old legacy economy of atoms, and the new digital economy of bits at the level of both physics _and_ economics. It is _the_ game changer. The game changer that most of us haven‚Äôt even seen yet üëÄ.


## üö© But ‚Ä¶ the first copy can be costly

So while digital stuff can be copied for free, which is amazing, does this mean all information is just simply free???

No, unfortunately not! This miracle comes with a but!

While digital stuff can be copied for free ‚Äì again _amazing_ ‚Äì creating the original ‚Äúcopy‚Äù is NOT costless. In fact, it can be very expensive as you may have noted from our earlier examples of medicines and movies. A new movie can cost a hundred million dollars or more to create ‚Äì even if it can then be copied for less than a cent ‚Äì the price of a download ‚Äì or a drug, could require hundreds of millions of dollars in research and trials before it is ready for market. So, as you can see, this can create a bit of a dilemma. A dilemma we‚Äôre going to explore in detail in what comes next.


## Today‚Äôs summary 

**Costless copying is the key principle** to understanding the new digital economy. It is the essential, fundamental difference between old and new - at the level of physics and economics.

In the old economy of atoms, we can‚Äôt all wear the same shoes: if you‚Äôre wearing them, I can‚Äôt be too. But in the new digital world: sharing is not only possible, it's natural. In this new world sharing does not mean less. This ability to share also does not cost more. It is costless, once the first copy has been made.  


‚è© Next up‚Ä¶ So what about that ‚Äúfirst copy‚Äù? Even if all later copies are free we have to find a way to pay for the original article! How are we going to do that and what does it mean for our economy? Tune in tomorrow to find out!
