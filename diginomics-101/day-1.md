# **Day 1: We’re in a new digital economy**

Dear future diginomist,

Today is an exciting day. Do you know why? 

Today is the day you get to embark on a new adventure into the digital world. Here you will gain profound insights into the new digital world we are now living in. 

It’s probably obvious that a big shift is going on in our economies and societies, a shift to a digital world, a digital economy. It can seem overwhelming, bewildering, geeky. But in fact, the basic principles of this new economy are simple. And once you see them, everything else related to understanding the digital economy falls into place.

Are you ready to start the journey? Let’s go!!

## Legacy economy vs Digital Economy 101

We have two different economies operating side by side today.

**The first is the legacy economy.** This old economy is a world of physical stuff like bread, steel, and shoes. Until very recently this was the only economy there was. This was the economy we all lived and worked in. All of our laws, regulations, wealth, ownership and status has been predominantly governed by physical things - how they are produced, owned, and traded. 

**The other is the new, digital economy. **This new economy is a world of digital stuff like software, databases and AI. This is the economy that’s taking over: we navigate our trip’s using google maps instead of a physical map, Amazon provides us with everything straight to our front door, and everyone has a smartphone or a computer.

Want to know how significant this is? It is estimated that in 2022 alone we created and consumed 97 _trillion_ gigabytes of digital information. To put that into perspective, if we imagine that a gigabyte is the size of a penny, then 97 trillion gigabytes would create a tower of pennies big enough to go to the moon, back to earth, and then to the moon again _97 times over. _

This vast number is because today more than ⅔ of the world’s population – 5 billion people – are connected to the internet.

And it’s about business too: seven of the world’s ten largest companies are tech companies (Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta, Apple, NVIDIA, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.). Even the final three, Tesla, the Saudi Aramco oil company and the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate use lots of digital technology and digital information in their activities.

**And it’s more than the software companies and tech startups, digital is now everywhere including the legacy physical economy**: think about the last time you went to the supermarket. The cash register is electronic, the assistants check inventory on their smartphones, deliveries are tracked and scheduled via software and much more. Today, just buying some apples involves a lot of digital technology. Or what about placing your online food order for home delivery? Lots of digital information linking together to fulfil something we simply take for granted - food we requested delivered fresh to our door. Digital is everywhere. 

The problem is that we often view digital as just a part of the legacy economy when, in actual fact, there ‘s something profoundly different and new about the digital world.


## Atoms and Bits

**Physical goods are made up of atoms, and digital goods are made up of bits.** This is the first important difference to notice.

Maybe you’re thinking, well that’s obvious, which is great. But if we dig a little deeper these two concepts - atoms _and_ bits - can seem quite similar: they are both the basic units which make up all other stuff. So you may be asking, aren’t bits just digital atoms? The answer is no. Bits are so much more than digital atoms and it is this fundamental fact that requires us to develop a new way of thinking if we want to make sense of our new digital economy.

As with any discussion of diginomics, we need to start by emphasising just how significant digital information has become in our world today, because we can often overlook it. We truly are living in the digital age, and with the rapid advancement of machine learning technologies trained on vast amounts of digital information **and** capable of generating massive amounts of novel information as an output as well, the role of digital is only going to increase.


## Today’s summary

We are living in a new economy - a digital economy. Our old economy was organised around physical stuff - atoms, whilst our new economy is organised around digital stuff - bits. Digital is everywhere, whether you realise it or not.
