# [Day 1] Plagues and whips: why mental models matter

## Getting the right mental model

Getting a proper handle on the core principles of the digital world is important.

The human mind understands the world and shapes our expectations about how it behaves according to _models. _Having constructed a mental model from our past experiences, we use that model as we encounter new things.

For example, if we see something brown and large in the trees ahead our mental model kicks in and makes the prediction it’s a bear – and we should run away. We don’t stick around and do a lot of specific investigation – who knows, perhaps this was just a large tree! 

This heuristic reasoning is essential and allows us to navigate our complex world. But our mental models aren’t always correct, and applying the wrong model can have serious consequences.

Back in the 14th century the “black death” (bubonic plague) ravaged Eurasia and North Africa. One in three people died in Europe and in some cities one out of two people died.

People of the time grappled with how to make sense of what was going on – can you imagine COVID but without modern medicine or science. This meant applying the mental models they’d created of how the world worked to this new and terrifying phenomenon.

In Europe, a key aspect of people’s mental models was the supremacy of God. On this understanding, infection was a sign of sin requiring penance. And for many, an obvious way of demonstrating penance before the Almighty was whipping yourself until you bled.

This response became so popular it sparked a movement, which have since become dubbed as the Flagellants, who would march from town to town brutally whipping themselves in order to show God they were worthy of forgiveness.

This approach made sense, with a mental model which saw the plague as a sign from an omnipotent deity inclined to punishment and forgiveness. However we now know the plague was a highly infectious bacterial disease. In this case, marching from town to town with open wounds and encouraging others to whip themselves was actually harmful – modern research has in fact shown that the Flagellants contributed significantly to the spread of the Black Death across Europe. 

Now this is an extreme illustration. But it demonstrates the importance of having the right mental model – and the dangers of applying the wrong one. And we’re about to see that most people have the wrong mental model for the digital world: they are applying a model from the old, legacy economy to the new digital one.
