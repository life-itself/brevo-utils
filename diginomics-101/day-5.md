# **Day 5: Exclusive rights "property": one way to pay for the first copy**

Dear future diginomist,

Let’s return to our fairy-tale from yesterday and add a twist. No-one likes to lose money, least of all Mr Gates. That’s why the legacy economy, this world of atoms, has generally worked so well, so it kind of makes sense to keep working with these rules, no? Well let’s find out!

## How Mr Gates kept his gold coins

**Let’s go back to Mr Gates**. Let’s imagine that Mr Gates realised there could be a problem with his magical apple tree because of replanting. He knew he needed to prevent this problem from happening as the consequences for him could be catastrophic, losing not only his 10 gold coins but also his future gold coins as well! So, Mr Gates carefully removed the cores of all the apples he sold. This prevented the magical apple tree from being reproduced, and thus allowed him to take over the apple supply industry and make a lot of money.

**I had it first.** This is the best justification for intellectual property (IP) rights - I had it first and therefore, it is mine to make money from. So, with digital goods because making new copies doesn’t cost anything, all the money generated from selling a new copy (known as the revenue) is profit. This means that selling digital goods can be incredibly profitable – as long as further illegal copying and redistribution is prevented. It is also a way to ensure the costs of the costly first “copy” are recuperated.

**Costless copying is a big deal!** Let’s look at an actual example. Microsoft had a profit of over $21 billion in just one quarter in 2023 from its MS Office software, Windows operating system, and video game sales in one year alone. And Microsoft manages to keep a staggering amount of the revenue it generates as profit: from a total of $198 billion of revenue in 2022, Microsoft was left with $83.4 billion of income before tax. How? Costless copying. 


## But wait, there’s a problem

This application of exclusive rights towards digital products creates unintended side-effects. Let’s go back to Mr Gates and his magical apple tree to illustrate. 

Firstly, with exclusive rights, this approach can mean that some people who want or need apples, don’t get any now.

**Are we all going to starve?** Imagine Hansel and Gretel, two poor children, who can’t afford to buy any apples or any food at all. In the free apple world suddenly they had food on the table every day – even if it was just apples! Whereas now they are starving, and they will continue to starve because no one else, apart from Mr Gates, produces apples now - either for free or at a cost.

Secondly, these exclusive rights create a monopoly, which leads to massive inequalities in wealth and power. In the world of the magical apple tree this is demonstrated by all the other apple farmers going out of business and Mr Gates getting very, very rich. Now, although this can and does happen in the digital world, it often shows up more subtly than that as an economy wide phenomena and that is why we can often miss it. For more information on this you can join our _The Hidden Digital Cause of Rising Inequality course_.


## Today’s summary

In today’s lesson we introduced the problems that can arise when we apply exclusive rights, as we are used to doing in the world of atoms, to the digital economy. **Applying exclusive rights to digital bits can create two major consequences:** people who want or need these items miss out predominantly because they can’t afford the cost to access them and secondly a monopoly is created which leads to mass inequality, even more so than in the physical world.

⏩ Next up… In the old world of atoms, having a simple apple tree didn’t create any problems. All the farmers could supply apples aplenty and no one really missed out. Physically owning property worked well. So surely the problem is costless copying, no? Well, let’s find out in the next lesson…
