# **Day 0: Are you ready to transform your understanding of the digital world? 🤯 🗺️**

Dear future diginomist,

Since you enrolled in this introductory masterclass, that means you want to learn more about the digital economy and how it is relevant to you. 

**Over the course of the next seven days, we’re going to share principles and insights with you that will transform the way that you look at the digital economy forever.**

You will:

* Gain a whole new perspective about the digital economy
* Know the real difference between digital and physical - and it’s not what you think
* Review the rules we are currently working with and why they aren’t working in the digital economy
* Understand the implications of the digital economy, where it is taking us, and what this means for you, and society in general 
* Know the next steps and where we go from here


#### Over the next 7 lessons, we are going to give you a whole new way of thinking about the digital economy.

After you complete this introductory course, you will never think about the world the same way again.

We are going to teleport you out of the legacy world of atoms (and the misunderstanding that keep people from navigating our digital world), and teleport you into the future of bits (where sharing is easy, information is plentiful, and free access for everyone is possible – if we can find a way to pay for that first copy).

We are going to show you how you can become a digital economics expert, a diginomist, too.

Here’s what we’re going to cover:

🌎 **Day #1: We’re in a new digital economy:** We’re going to explain to you in a really simple way the difference between the old legacy economy and the new digital economy. And, more importantly, we’re going to show you why it’s relevant to you.

🧠 **Day #2: It’s more than digital, it’s information:** There is one small fact tripping most people up when it comes to understanding the digital economy, and that is what we will cover in today’s lesson. Through introducing atoms and bits we will start to expand your awareness and we even address why you might be feeling frustrated in the digital economy, all in one lesson!

🍌 **Day #3: Costless copying: the essential difference between bits and atoms:** By now you might already have ideas about the essential difference between the old legacy economy and the new digital economy. In this lesson we get clear on the essential difference and how HUGE this difference truly is at the level of physics and economics. We introduce you to the miracle hiding in plain sight! This lesson is extra juicy!

🍏 **Day #4: The magical apple tree: understand the digital economy:** Talking of juicy, in this lesson we introduce you to Mr Gates and his magical apple tree. We examine the problems that can occur with costless copying, because there’s always a problem, right?

🏡 **Day #5: Exclusive rights aka "property": one possible way to pay for the first copy:** Want to know what happens when we apply our old model of exclusive rights to the world of digital? Well, then this lesson is for you. Although we can make lots of money (hooray) we also have more problems too (boo). So what do we do?? Find out in day 5’s lesson!

👠 **Day #6: Costless copying revisited:** In this lesson we dive in deeper to costless copying, especially when combined with exclusive rights. You’ll discover the hidden link with growing inequality and political populism. You’ll see why combining exclusive rights with costless copying creates “explosive” tensions that didn’t exist in the old world of atoms. Real knock-on societal issues that didn't exist before, or at least not to this extent. And we see how it all goes back to that essential difference: costless copying.

💥 **Day #7: Core tension: access vs innovation:** In the final lesson of this course we look at the core tension at play within the information economy, that of access vs innovation. A tension that shows up in conflicts over access to essential medicines during the AIDS epidemic to tensions over funding the software we use everyday. Finally, we ask if there is a way out of this tension?

**Are you ready to get started?**

Our first lesson is on the difference between the Legacy Economy and Digital Economy.

_​We bet you can’t wait until it hits your inbox tomorrow._ 😉

See you soon!
