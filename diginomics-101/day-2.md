# **Day 2: It‚Äôs more than digital, it‚Äôs information**

Dear future diginomist,

Do you know why most people get frustrated with the digital economy and over complicate it in their heads? Today, we‚Äôre going to tell you and it is all related to one simple fact, that once we tell you it will seem so obvious.

But first, let‚Äôs have some fun. Take a look at the image below, and answer this question: 

**Of the three items, which one is the odd one out?** ü§î

<table width="100%">

Shall we tell you? Later . . . first, let‚Äôs jump in and examine what it is about digital bits that are so important.


## It‚Äôs all about the information 

As mentioned in the previous lesson, the fundamental difference between the legacy economy and the new digital economy is that the new digital economy is based on **bits **and the old economy is based on **atoms.**

This new economy full of bits can be referred to by a number of terms; the digital economy, the digital world, the information economy and the information world. These terms are all talking about the same thing - these bits, and these bits hold information, so you can think of them as simply ‚Äòbits of information‚Äô.

Therefore, the most important, and very simple, concept to understand about the new digital economy is that digital simply means information:

**Digital (Bits) = (Bits of) Information**

When this information is accessible through technology then it becomes known as digital information. This ‚Äòdigital‚Äôness i.e. the technology, functions as the vehicle that transports and shares (these bits of) information, which is why it is frequently referred to as simply digital. The courier carries your package of atoms, the digital technology carries your bits of information.


## Expanding our awareness

It‚Äôs important to realise that ‚Äúdigital information‚Äù is much more than software, databases and online movies ‚Äì as significant as those already are for our economy and lives.

Think of the formulae for new pharmaceutical drugs to the digital 3D models used to design everyday products like chairs or shoes. Think of the genetic modifications made to many crops, or the temperature and humidity sensors used to control the climates in industrial greenhouses growing food. These all use digital information. It is everywhere.

When we understand that information is simply a sequence of signs humans use to convey meaning, we can see that almost everything in today‚Äôs economy is underpinned by digital information somewhere. Which wasn‚Äôt the case previously, a key point worth noting as we move through this course. 


## Why we get frustrated

**Now this shift to bits of information has created a lot of frustration for some people.** This frustration has been accumulating over time as more changes happen (the importance of and use of bits overtaking the atoms at high speed) and less and less is understood about them. 

This lack of understanding, or in reality accessible knowledge, creates frustration and leads to people seeking or accepting support and answers from the wrong places - from people and organisations promoting old world rules (made for atoms) because that's what used to work. This approach, using old rules in a new digital world, only adds to the frustration because these old rules no longer work in a digital economy, and therefore the cycle of frustration continues. 

**So how do we address working with new rules for a new economy?** Well, the digital information economy is fundamentally different from the physical economy in **one **crucial way, through the principle of **costless copying**. When we start to make and live by new rules related to this principle of costless copying we can start to clear the frustration. But more on this in the next lesson. 

Now, let‚Äôs go back to the images we looked at at the beginning of the lesson today.

We asked you the question: **Which one is the odd one out? **

What do you think?

**Well, the answer is the (non-GMO) banana** üòÑüçå. 

Do you know why? 

Let me tell you. The (non GMO) banana is the only item of the three that is primarily made, or whose value comes from, atoms. Whilst the other two, the movie and the pill, are primarily made of information ‚Äì even if they have some atoms in them too, in the case of the pill for example. The key value of the movie and the pill comes from the informational aspects that are needed to create it, unlike the banana, whose value is atomic.

Did you guess correctly? ‚Ä¶ Good job üëç

**Let me ask you another question.** What is this difference between digital stuff and atom stuff? Take a moment to think about this ‚Ä¶

Is it that it‚Äôs faster? Easier? There‚Äôs less privacy? Cheaper? ‚Ä¶ What do you think?


## Today‚Äôs summary

Today we learnt that we now live in an economy of information, of bits, a digital economy and therefore, whether we are aware or not **_diginomics,_** the rules of the digital economy, influence every aspect of our lives. This has many more far reaching implications than we realise, because we are currently running a new economy of bits (of information) on old rules related to physical atoms, and this is causing rising frustration personally and globally.

‚è© Next up‚Ä¶ In the next lesson we will tell you the **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">essential</span>** difference between digital stuff and atom stuff; we‚Äôre going to explain why this difference is so essential and how that single insight can help you understand (almost) everything that is happening in the digital economy.
