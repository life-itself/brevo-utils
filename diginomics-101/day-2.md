# [Day 2] Atoms vs Bits: Legacy Economy vs Digital Economy

Digital stuff like software and database are different from physical goods like bread and steel

There’s one single huge difference. Once you get that everything else follows.

Physical goods are made of atoms. Digital goods are made of bits. At one level these seem quite similar: the basic units which make up all other objects. So aren’t bits just digital atoms?

The answer is NO!!

## The big difference: costless copying

The reason is simple and core to everything that follows: COSTLESS COPYING

Bits differ from atoms because of COSTLESS COPYING!!

Bits can be copied costlessly … whilst atoms can’t be! From a dataset to a piece of software to an MP3 of a music file, once you’ve got a copy of any digital good you can copy it as many times as you want – for free. That isn’t so for for physical goods like bread, tractors and cars.

TODO: something to really have this sink in …

Maybe see the broader implications …?

This means that the owner of the _original _copy can sell as many copies as they like at no added cost (just like our farmer in the magic money tree story). It also means that a buyer of a copy can then copy this as many times as they wish and give it out to as many people as they like for no added cost. These possibilities have some major implications, which we’ll start discussing tomorrow. 

TODO: emphasize mental model point The reason we can’t apply our mental models of physical goods and atoms to the world of digital goods

## But … the first copy can be costly

While digital stuff can be copied for free, creating the original copy is NOT costless. In fact, it can be very expensive.

This is because creating the first copy involves labour and capital, and what’s more often requires highly skilled labour and very specialist capital. Think of writing and shooting a Hollywood movie, the team of software engineers coding a new app or the group of scientists conducting experiments to devise a new pharmaceutical formula. These processes often involve expert staff using complex equipment, and none of this comes cheap.

Furthermore, the creative process for digital goods is inherently uncertain and therefore risky. By definition new information or new knowledge is not known in advance, and for all refined professional processes and strategies used the discovery process still essentially amounts to “having a go at something, seeing how it turns out, and adjusting accordingly”. We might be able to predict with some degree of accuracy how long these discovery processes will take, but by their nature we can’t know for sure. They might even fail completely, as evidenced by the host of films that get shelved part-way through filming or pharmaceuticals that never make it to market. Sure there is uncertainty being a farmer about next year's harvest, but the uncertainty with knowledge production is intrinsic to the very nature of the thing being produced. 

As creating new copies of digital goods is near costless, essentially all of the costs of their production come from creating the first copy. This is totally unlike the production of physical goods, where there is a cost attached to each new copy made; each one requires the use of materials and the completion of some form of production process to turn them into the finished article, all of which costs money. 

## Summary and tomorrow’s lesson {#summary-and-tomorrow’s-lesson}

This radical difference in how the production process works, and how the costs of production are structured, means that digital goods are fundamentally different to their physical counterparts, and therefore, require different mental models to ensure they operate efficiently. Tomorrow, we’ll outline the main implications of this difference, but before you can remind yourself using the summary table below:
